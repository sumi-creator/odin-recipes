# odin-recipes	
My first HTML project.
I created this page using HTML basics, I'll come back to style it with CSS.	


-I created 3 web pages with 3 recipes each that I linked to the main page.
-Each page has a short description of the dish, a list of ingredients and another list of steps needed to prepare it.
